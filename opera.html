        CHORUS.                                 Alas!<br>

  FIA.           Are four-and-twenty,
                 They, alas!<br>

  CHORUS.                                 Alas!<br>

  FIA.           Are only two.<br>

  CHORUS.        They, alas, are only two, alas!<br>
                 Now ye know, ye dainty roses,<br>
                 Roses white and roses red,<br>
                 Why we bind you into posies,<br>
                      Ere your morning bloom has fled,<br>
                      Roses white and roses red!<br>

  (During this chorus Antonio, Francesco, Giorgio, and other<br>
  Gondoliers have entered unobserved by the Girls—at first two,<br>
  then two more, then four, then half a dozen, then the remainder<br>
  of the Chorus.)<br>

                                SOLI.<br>

  FRANC.    Good morrow, pretty maids; for whom prepare ye<br>
            These floral tributes extraordinary?<br>

  FIA.      For Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri,<br>
            The pink and flower of all the Gondolieri.<br>

  GIU.      They're coming here, as we have heard but lately,<br>
            To choose two brides from us who sit sedately.<br>

  ANT.      Do all you maidens love them?<br>

  ALL.                                    Passionately!<br>

  ANT.      These gondoliers are to be envied greatly!<br>

  GIOR.     But what of us, who one and all adore you?<br>
            Have pity on our passion, we implore you!<br>

  FIA.      These gentlemen must make their choice before you;<br>

  VIT.      In the meantime we tacitly ignore you.<br>
